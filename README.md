A strategic turn-based card game where deck building, battles, and card ownership are all managed through smart contracts.

Core Game Structure

Card System

    Each card is an NFT with unique stats and abilities
    Cards have rarity tiers (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary) with different mint probabilities
    Card attributes stored on-chain: attack, defense, mana cost, special abilities
    Players can trade cards on secondary markets or combine cards to create stronger variants

Deck Building

    Players construct 30-card decks from their owned cards
    Deck compositions stored on-chain with cryptographic hashes
    Meta-game emerges as players adapt to popular strategies
    Deck templates can be shared and monetized by successful players

Battle System Match Setup

    Players stake entry fees and commit to matches through smart contract
    Deck lists are encrypted and committed before battle begins
    Matchmaking based on player ranking and stake amount

Turn-Based Mechanics

    Each turn, players submit encrypted action commitments
    Actions include: play card, attack, use ability, end turn
    Smart contract validates moves and updates game state
    Random elements (card draws, ability effects) use verifiable randomness

Battle Resolution

    Turns execute simultaneously after both players commit
    Combat damage, card effects, and state changes calculated on-chain
    Game ends when one player's health reaches zero
    Winner claims staked tokens and ranking points
